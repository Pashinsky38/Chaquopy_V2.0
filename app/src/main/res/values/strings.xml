    <string name="conditional_statements_explanation">Conditional statements (if, elif, else) allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.\n\nThe elif keyword allows you to add multiple conditions. If the if condition is false, it checks the elif conditions one by one. If an elif condition is true, its code is executed, and the rest are skipped. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the else block, if present, is executed.</string>
